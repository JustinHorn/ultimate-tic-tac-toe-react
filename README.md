Ultimate tic-tac-toe with React.js
==================================

Extension of the React.js tutorial: implementation of [ultimate tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe). You can play it at <http://minimuino.github.io/ultimate-tic-tac-toe-react>.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and published with [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages).

Guide
-----

1. Complete the basic tic-tac-toe app of the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
2. Complete additional features listed at the [end of the tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#wrapping-up). These include:
	1. Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
	2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
	3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
	4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
	5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
	6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
3. Generalise the app for a N-sized board (see this [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1056316/algorithm-for-determining-tic-tac-toe-game-over)).
4. Add form to select board size and other future options.
5. Add a timer for each player.
6. Build the ultimate tic-tac-toe version.
