# Ultimate tic-tac-toe AI with React.js

Refactored everthing execept grid.

removed generic size since, trust me,  
you only wanna play size:3  
squares that shouldnt be clickable, now aint clickable

added web worker and random ai, as monte Carlo ai.

---

I guess I should have just coded everything on my own - well never mind
